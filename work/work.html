        <h3>
            Working at UTA, ULA, and the Boys and Girls Club of Cabarrus County has greatly contributed
            to my personal and professional growth. Each experience has taught me valuable lessons in teamwork,
            leadership, and real-world problem-solving. Alongside these roles, working on personal coding projects
            is crucial. It builds practical skills, fosters creativity, and provides hands-on experience that deepens 
            my understanding of programming concepts, allowing me to 
            explore and overcome challenges that might otherwise go unnoticed in a formal setting.
